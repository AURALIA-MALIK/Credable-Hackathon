# Credable-Hackathon
In order to maximize profitability and properly forecast inventory requirements, we have to undertake 2 important (and related) exercises: determining the business rules that govern what product we sell and when, and, out of this, forecast units sold by month.

The Exercise:

In this exercise, you will determine the mix of cash loans (an upsell loan) and Product upgrades (an upgrade loan) we'll sell to Current customers in 2023 in order to maximize upgrade + upsell profitability (Classics Assets Products are the core Mobile Phone, Tablet, Decoder, Radio, phone-charging product).

Questions to Answer:

* How many cash loans and TV upgrades will we sell, by month, in 2023, under the optimal profit-maximizing product mix?
* How much profit will we make under the optimal product mix?
* How could we potentially adjust business rules to improve profitability? (be creative!)
* What operational improvements should we investigate to improve profitability (i.e., which assumptions are most sensitive / we should aim to 'improve')?

Conclusions
* By leveraging time series forecasting models, such as SARIMA, it is possible to predict future sales trends and anticipate demand fluctuations.
* While the dataset reflects positive sales trends, there may be opportunities for improvement in various areas such as customer experience enhancement, and operational efficiency.
* The dataset provides insights into customer preferences and purchasing patterns, which can inform pricing strategies and targeted marketing efforts to better cater to customer needs.

Recommendations
* Encourage cross-functional teams to work together towards common goals and shared objectives.
* Leverage data analytics and business intelligence tools to derive actionable insights from the sales data.
* Solicit feedback from customers to identify areas for improvement and address their evolving needs effectively.
